The R Markdown ecosystem is a collection of free and open source packages, developed and maintained by [RStudio, PBC](https://rstudio.com/). 

## Installation and use

Install R Markdown by running:

```r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

The rmarkdown package provides many different output formats "out of the box" including HTML pages, Word documents, and PDFs.

If you are using [RStudio as your integrated development environment (IDE)](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), you do not need to explicitly install or load the rmarkdown package, as RStudio automatically does both when needed. You also will not need to install Pandoc (<https://pandoc.org>), because RStudio has bundled it for you.

## Extension packages

For additional output format options, you can explore additional packages in the R Markdown ecosystem that give you access to more styles, layouts, and applications to extend R Markdown.
