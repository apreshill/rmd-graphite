  Use Markdown to format the narrative text in your `.Rmd`. Try out RStudio's Visual Markdown Editor to start learning.

Everything that is not code in your `.Rmd` is called narrative text, and can be styled with Markdown. Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax, which means everything you see in the file itself can be typed with a normal keyboard. Below is an example:

## Add structure

You can use Markdown to organize your `.Rmd` file with headings. Headings are useful for organizing your document into sections, and with Markdown formatting you can have up to 6 types/sizes of headers. Use a hash symbol like `#` before the label to create a new header.

All narrative text in your `.Rmd` file can be formatted to add **bold**, *italics*, bulletted lists, numbered lists, superscripts<sup>1</sup>, and subscripts<sub>1</sub>.
