## What is R Markdown?

R Markdown is a tool designed for anyone who uses code to work with data. You can use R Markdown at any stage of an analysis project, any time you want to develop code and ideas alongside each other. 

Start an R Markdown project if you want to:

* Save, execute, and explain your code, all in the same place. 

* Transform your code into polished and professional data products&mdash;reports, dashboards, websites, slides, even books&mdash;that are ready to be shared.
