# The Great British Bake Off

The Great British Bake Off (also called *Bake Off* or *GBBO*) is a British television baking competition.

The first series featured a different baking **theme** each week:

1.  Cakes
2.  Biscuits
3.  Bread
4.  Puddings
5.  Pastry
6.  Tea Party

In each episode, the amateur bakers are given three challenges based on that week's theme:

-   A signature bake,
-   a technical challenge,
-   and a show-stopper.
